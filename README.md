**Navigate to directory:**

`cd nords`


**Install node dependencies:**

**Run development server:**

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


**Builds the app for production to the build folder:**
